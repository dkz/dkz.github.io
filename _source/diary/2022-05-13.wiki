Rich Hickey:

    What kind of a runner can run as fast as they possibly can from the very
    start of a race?  Right, only somebody who runs really short races.  But of
    course, we are programmers and we are smarter than runners; apparently
    because we know how to fix that problem.  We just fire the starting pistol
    every hundred yards and call it a new sprint.
