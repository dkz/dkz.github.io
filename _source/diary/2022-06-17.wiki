= Tools to Improve Writing =

I was using thesaurus.com for a long time to better my writing. Primarily to
spice it with more colorful passages, or make it generally more conforming. In
all honesty, formal English makes me struggle; it takes me hours to write a
business email or a letter.

To my surprise, that annoying site can be avoided altogether.
Ubuntu's apt repository publishes `wordnet`, extraordinary powerful lexical
database; and `dict-gcide`, allegedly the best English dictionary^[1]^.

{{{
  sudo apt install wordnet dict-gcide
}}}

According to Michael A. Covington's advice, it is important to not use words if
you don't know what they mean ^[2]^. Now if I am not confident in an exact
sense of the word at hand, `wordnet` and the dictionary provide tremendous
assistance in the matter. `dict [word]` presents a comprehensive definition
with a lot of examples, and `wn [word] -over` gives an overview of synonym
rings.
