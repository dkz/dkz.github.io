= Data-centric Design =

Unix philosophy is what actually caught my eye^[1]^.

Linux utilities are designed around textual data. This is what makes them
infinitely useful: they most of the time manipulate with text entries separated
by newlines. Data can be easily crafted, analyzed, transferred, and most
importantly it is humanly readable. Text editor is all that is needed to
manipulate it manually. In fact, I like the idea of using simple text formats a
lot^[2]^.

On the side note: the mechanism behind Linux piping is impressive^[3]^.

Data makes it easy to break down each step of the program, test every piece in
isolation, prove its correctness, etc. It easy to pre-record test cases just
from real-life data: just record it to a log file.

Weirdly enough, everything above can be said about Clojure^[4]^.

When system deviates from this data-centric design, it requires external tools
for assistance in reading and manipulating inputs/outputs of different parts of
the system. Which is tedious as best.
