= Explaining Code using ASCII Art =

A quote^[1]^:

    People tend to be visual: we use pictures to understand problems.
    Mainstream programming languages, on the other hand, operate in an almost
    completely different kind of abstract space, leaving a big gap between
    programs and pictures.

I decided to check out tools which may help with visualizing graphs or
structures. And found this tool^[2]^, which is written in Perl. Here's how to
install it:

{{{
apt install libgraph-easy-perl
}}}

It follows Graphviz dot language format^[3]^:

{{{
digraph {
  rankdir = RL;
  A -> B [label="text"];
  B -> C;
  A -> C;
  E -> C;
  E -> A;
}
}}}

And it can be rendered as box-art graph directly in VIM.
Simple as `:!graph-easy --as boxart`.
