= ASCII Separators =

ASCII separator characters make parsing of tabular data trivial.

CSV has been a bane of tabular data for many years. Primarily because it is
awful for arbitrary data like results of SQL queries. Especially if it contains
newlines, commas, and quotation marks.

ASCII has these fancy non-printable characters that almost never appear in any
textual data. Why aren't they used more often?

| Code   | Role             |
|--------|------------------|
| `0x1f` | Unit separator   |
| `0x1e` | Record separator |
| `0x1c` | File separator   |

PostgresQL client is customizable enough to output query results using
non-orthodox field and record separators

{{{bash
  psql -q ${_connection_info} << EOF > activity.usrs
    \pset format unaligned
    \pset footer off
    \pset fieldsep '\x1f'
    \pset recordsep '\x1e'
    \echo -n 'pg_stat_activity.usrs'
    \echo -n '\x1c'
    select * from pg_stat_activity;
    \echo -n '\x1c'
    \echo -n 'pg_locks.usrs'
    \echo -n '\x1c'
    select * from pg_locks;
  EOF
}}}

Multiple tables can be saved into a single file thanks to file separator
character. Later it can be parsed and examined with a simple Python script.
