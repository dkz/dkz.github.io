<p>
"The process of seeking solutions is certainly a big part of a researcher's
life, but really it's in everybody's life. I don't want to get deep into
philosophy, but the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible says essentially this:
</p>
<blockquote>
Life is hard and then you die. You can, however, enjoy the process of
living; don't worry about the fact that you're going to die. Some bad
people have a good life, and some good people have a bad life, and that
doesn't seem fair; but don't worry about that either. Just think about ways
of enjoying the journey.
</blockquote>

<p>
"Again I'm oversimplifying, but that's the message I find in many parts of the
Bible. For example, it turns up in Philippians 3:16, where the writer says
that:"
</p>
<blockquote>
You don't race to get to the goal; the process of racing itself, of keeping
the pace, is the real goal.
</blockquote>

<p>
"In Christian churches I am least impressed by a sermon that talks about how
marvelous heaven is going to be at the end. To me that's not the message of
Christianity. The message is about how to live now, not that we should live in
some particular way because there's going to be pie in the sky some day. The
end means almost nothing to me. I am glad it's there, but I don't see it as
much of a motivating force, if any. I mean, it's the journey that's important."
