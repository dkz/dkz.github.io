<blockquote>
My best advice about writer's block is: the reason you're having a hard
time writing is because of a conflict between the GOAL of writing well and
the FEAR of writing badly. By default, our instinct is to conquer the fear,
but our feelings are much, much, less within our control than the goals we
set, and since it's the conflict BETWEEN the two forces blocking you, if
you simply change your goal from "writing well" to "writing badly," you
will be a veritable fucking fountain of material, because guess what, man,
we don’t like to admit it, because we’re raised to think lack of confidence
is synonymous with paralysis, but, let’s just be honest with ourselves and
each other: we can only hope to be good writers.
