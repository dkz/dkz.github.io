<p>
Working on automation for small-to-medium size businesses,
chances are high your infrastructure is not homogeneous.
And each individual deployment is a bit of a mess.
Customers are more important than others.
Some have barely any load.
Some, on the opposite, scrupulously monitored.
</p>

<p>
Then, there's evolution of company practices.
Half of the deployments were orchestrated by Ansible.
Others were deployed manually.
Few machines still run on Ubuntu 18.04.
Few still have SysV style init.
The list of differences goes on and on.
</p>

<p>
The issue: each deployment is unique,
each incident requires extra time to grasp the differences before reacting.
</p>

<p>
Today's HN submission<sup><small>[1]</small></sup> touches that topic a bit.
I might borrow an idea of having a runbook on a server.
Altogether with modified MOTD containing a cheatsheet and brief description of the deployment.
